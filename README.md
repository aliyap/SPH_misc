# SPH_misc

Some code I wrote for SPH simulations. Very bare bone. 
The code quality/functionality is _very_ likely to improve in the near future, but expecting much before beginning of September would be a mistake. Before then look at your own risk and don't expect much!

SPH 
- simple 2D SPH implementation 
- based on Alg 1 in STAR paper on SPH by 
https://graphics.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/papers/Sol14/2014_EG_SPH_STAR.pdf

PBF 
- simple 2D implementation of PBF liquid simulation
- based on the paper by Macklin
http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf

The following 3 projects are based on the paper by 
http://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2015_SIGGRAPH_viscousSPH.pdf

SPH_explicit
- 2D PBF with explicit full form viscosity 

SPH_experiment
- 2D PBF with implicit full form viscosity 

BUCKLE_3d 
- 3D PBF with implicit full form viscosity 
- likely something wrong with coefficients, since it doesn't look good/accurate
